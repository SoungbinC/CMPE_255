# A Comparative Analysis of Loan Approval Factors: 2010 vs. 2020

## Abstract

This research investigates the changing dynamics of loan approval factors over a decade, supported by hypothetical data from 2010 and 2020. We assess the influence of credit scores, employment history, and digital footprints in the loan approval process.

## 1. Introduction

The digitization of financial processes suggests a shift in loan approval factors. Our study quantifies these changes over a decade.

## 2. Literature Review

-   **Smith (2015)**: Highlighted the dominance of credit scores in 2010.
-   **Johnson et al. (2018)**: Recognized the rise of digital behavior analytics by 2020.

## 3. Methodology

Data was extracted from the fictional National Financial Database (NFD). We analyzed 10,000 loan applications from both 2010 and 2020.

## 4. Results

-   **4.1** In 2010, credit scores were paramount in 85% of loan approvals.
-   **4.2** By 2020, credit scores influenced 60% of approvals, while digital behavior played a part in 30% of decisions.
-   **4.3** Employment history consistently impacted 15% of decisions across both years.

## 5. Discussion

-   **5.1** The shift from credit scores towards digital metrics from 2010 to 2020 marks the industry's adaptation to digital tools.
-   **5.2** The rising significance of digital behavior signifies a diversified risk assessment.

## 6. Limitations

The study relies on fictional data, offering a generalized overview rather than precise insights.

## 7. Conclusion

As the financial industry evolves, so do the metrics for loan approval. While traditional metrics remain foundational, digital metrics are becoming increasingly influential.

## 8. Recommendations

Future research should delve deeper into the implications and efficacy of digital behavior analytics.
