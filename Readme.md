1.  Write a colab for dimensionality reduction for PCA,SVA,MDS,IsoMap,UMAP,TSNE:

    -[Various Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/SoungbinC/CMPE_255/blob/Assignment8/Dimensionality_reduction.ipynb)

2.  Write a colab to illustrate how dimensionality reduction hechnique like umap can be used followed by cluerstring

    -[UMAP and Clustering](https://github.com/SoungbinC/CMPE_255/blob/Assignment8/Using_uamp_for_clustering.ipynb)

3.  Demonstrate dimensionality reduction using data bricks.

    -[Dimensionality Reduction using DataBricks](https://github.com/SoungbinC/CMPE_255/blob/Assignment8/CMPE255%20-%20Demonstrate%20dimensionality%20reduction.ipynb)

    I can't run on databricks. I don't know how to fix this at this point.
